# Slimeborne
Slimeborne is a single-player side-scrolling action-adventure game. The player plays as a slime that wields a fork, trying to find out its origin and defeating enemies that stand in its way. Discover items that can be attached to the fork to synthesize new weapons with different effects. As the player progresses, the game becomes increasingly difficult with more powerful enemies, increasingly complex and dangerous environments. The player will respawn at the last checkpoint when health is 0. To win the game, the player needs to defeat the final boss. This game appeals to players who enjoy combat, exploration and the souls-like genre.

## Key Features
- **Story & Atmosphere:** The world of Slimeborne is an atmospheric descent into tragedy. The narrative is rooted in a devastating factory accident that birthed the contaminated creatures and created a landscape of industrial decay. Following the Souls-like tradition of environmental storytelling, you must piece together the grim history of the world while navigating its haunting atmosphere.
- **Map Exploration:** Slimeborne features an expansive, non-linear, interconnected world designed to reward the persistent explorer. The map is seamlessly woven together across three uniquely themed levels, establishing a crucial organic difficulty curve as you have the freedom to push into challenging new areas whenever you feel ready.
- **Attachment System:** Attachments, hidden across the map, unlock new abilities necessary for solving environmental puzzles and accessing secrets. More critically, the system demands strategic thinking in combat: every enemy and boss has a weakness that must be exploited with the correct attachment.
- **Intense Combat & Climactic Bosses:** Combat in Slimeborne is a test of skill defined by a diverse array of mutated enemy types, ensuring that no two encounters feel the same. The journey is punctuated by three distinct, spectacular bosses, each serving as a formidable gatekeeper that forces you to master a new mechanic. From horizontal evasion to timed aerial jumps, these encounters guarantee climactic, high-stakes combat that rewards patience and mastery.
